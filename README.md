# UART Frame/Transmitter implementation!

* In this repository, you will find a SystemVerilog implementation of a UART Frame/Transmitter, which follows the guidelines outlined in the provided Lab2.pdf document. Please note that the verilog code includes an enable with bit counter, which was not included in the original document.

* To use the UART Frame/Transmitter, simply instantiate the module in your verilog code and connect it to your desired input and output ports. The module includes all necessary components for generating a UART frame and transmitting it, including a start bit, data bits and stop bit.

* Two PNG images have been included in the repository that demonstrate the expected output of the UART Frame/Transmitter module. Please note that the output may differ slightly based on the specific inputs and configurations used in your implementation.

If you have any questions or issues with the module, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to the repository owner for assistance.
