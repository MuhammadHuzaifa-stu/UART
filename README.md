# UART
This time I'm trying to implement UART frame/transmitter by using system verilog.
{Lab2.pdf} It contains all the necessary information that you need. But one thing is missing in it that there should be an enable with bit counter. Don't worry I have added it in my verilog code/
also 2 png's are attached for output.
